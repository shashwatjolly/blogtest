Hi!

I am working as a Software Developer at Microsoft, Redmond. I work on [Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/windows-admin-center), a customer-deployed, browser-based app for managing servers, clusters, hyper-converged infrastructure, and Windows PCs.

I graduated with a major in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India in 2020. As a part of my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis, I developed a Blockchain Simulator and proposed a model to validate any simulation framework. I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Kalpesh Kapoor](https://www.iitg.ac.in/kalpesh/).

You can reach out on any of my social media linked on the sidebar :)
