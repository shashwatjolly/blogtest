Hey everyone!

Over the past few months, I have been working on native EteSync integration in KDE's Kontact (PIM app suite). You can find more information about it [here](https://www.thejollyblog.tech/posts/KDE/gsoc-part-6-user-guide). I'm happy to announce the resource is now merged into the master branch of [the project](https://invent.kde.org/pim/kdepim-runtime), and will likely be release in the December release of KDE PIM. :D

This blog post, however is an announcement about my talk at Akademy 2020. Akademy is the annual world summit of KDE, one of the largest Free Software communities in the world. It is a free, non-commercial event organized by the KDE Community. It is being hosted online this year, and is open for everyone to attend.

My talk will revolve around my work on this new integration, which was also my [GSoC project](https://www.thejollyblog.tech/tag/g-so-c/). The talk gives a brief overview about my project, with a demo on how the integration works. It will be a short 5-minute talk with some additional time for answering questions, if any.

The talk is on **11th September, 17:00 UTC**.
Please feel free to join in and ask any questions you may have!
