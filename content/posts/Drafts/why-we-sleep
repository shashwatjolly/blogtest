I've been reading "Why we Sleep" by Mathew Walker. Here are some key insights I've gained.

If you cannot recall the last time you woke up, refreshed, without an alarm clock, you are NOT getting enough sleep.

- The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span. Now, this may not be of concern to you, but the problem is that the quality of that short life will be worse too.

- We sleep for 1/3rd of our life. We only ever care about how we spend the other 2/3rd.

- We are very vulnerable to attacks during sleep. Sleep must serve an absolutely vital function, else it is the biggest mistake the evolutionary process has ever made.

- Routinely sleeping less than 6-7 hours demolishes the immune system, more than doubles risk of cancer.

Two things play a role in feeling sleepy: 

- Circadian rythm: Biological clock of the body. Cycle of 24 hrs, reset by environmental cues (sunlight)

- Adenosine: Hormone continuously builds up in our body. Adenosine => desire to sleep. Broken down by the body during sleep.

Stages of sleep:

- Rapid Eye Movement(REM): We dream, relive recent memories, make new neural pathways. This is why we can wake up with a new solution to last night's problem.

- Non REM(NREM): Consolidates memories. Important stuff is moved to a long-term storage location.

The two stages cycle continuously for the time we sleep, with the concentration of REM sleep in each cycle increasing. An important consequence is that waking up 2 hours early does not simply mean losing 25% of your sleep. It means losing out on 60-90% of your REM sleep too.

On a personal note, I was routinely sleeping 4-5 hours before last week. I changed my sleeping schedule to accomodate 7-8 hours of sleep now, and wake up feeling much more alert, active and peaceful. Would recommend 10/10.

Sleeping less might be linked to depression, anxiety, mental health too. If you've been feeling down lately, try sleeping 8 hours consistently for a week. Maybe it will help :)
