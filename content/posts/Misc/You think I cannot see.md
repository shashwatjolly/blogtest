You think I don't see
your smile disappearing
when no one's watching you

You think I don't see
the scars on your wrist
which hold no candle
to those on your soul

You think I don't see
the trapped laughter
clouded by the sadness
in your eyes

You think I don't hear
the pain in your laughter,
the tears behind your smile

You think I don't see
a lot of things
But I do

I just cannot see
how someone could be
as brave as you
